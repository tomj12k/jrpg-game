@ @Please build a jrpg game framework with four classes, warrior, mage, healer, and rogue. The JRPG will have traditional elements similar to dragon quest. The game will start with a menu that has the following options: 1) Start game, 2) load game, 3) options, 4) exit. After clicking on start game, the player will be prompted to enter a name for their character, choose a class, which will have pre-defined stats, then select a difficulty level from easy, medium, and hard. Then the character can start the game, the game will load in a small town where they can walk around, interact with doors, other npcs to start quests, and open treasure chests. The player can leave the starting town and venture into the world where they can roam freeley between 20+ different cities, each with unique quests, main and side quests. The main quest will follow a unique storyline of the hackster bunny rabbit, side quests will allow them to collect data. While walking around in the world, the player will encounter enemies, and those enemies will scale with the zone and allow the player to grind to level up to 100, enemies will scale with difficulty in terms of health and damage. The player will learn 100 new skills as they level up and their stats will increase as they level. As the player levels up they can allocate stats between strength, agility, stamina, intellect, spirit, and defence all of which will make their character stronger in some way. Stamina will add more heath, agility will make the character get more critical hits, dodge attacks more; strength will block more damage with shields and armor, allow them to wear better armor, and increase their melee damage, intellect will increase spell power and max mana, spirit will increase magic resistence and mana regen rate, defence will reduce the damage received from melee and ragned types. The game should be a 2.5D top-down isometric style, with 8 dimension controls, pressing spacebar will pause the game and allow the player to save the game anywhere, exit the game, which will always ask to save before exiting; access their inventory to sort, use, discard items, of which there will be 40 unique items including 5 types of health regenerative items, 5 types of mana regenerative items, and other various damage dealing items, status removal and infliciting items as well as equipment for characters to wear, which can be equipped from the inventory screen. There will be an equipment option in this pause menu, where the player can equip helmet, chest, legs, primary weapon, secondary weapon, and three accessory items. From all equipment in the game there will be 300 total items spanning across all slots and each will improve the classes ability specifically, like there will be heavy armor only for warriors, cloth armor for mages, leather armor for rogues, and the healer can wear heavy as well, some heavy armor will be good for healing, some will be good for strength, accessories will improve health and give special bonuses for attack, defence, magic resistence, magic spell power, etc. There will be multiple weapon types like 5 different types for warriors, 3 for rogues, 2 for mages, 3 for healers, there will be upgrades for each weapon.
